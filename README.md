Sitefinityâ€™s personalization feature gives developers the power to create separate experiences for users grouped by a certain criteria. This sample demonstrates a scenario where you would want to personalize a page according to the day of the week. To achieve this functionality we will extend the default behavior of Sitefinity's personalization module to fit our needs.
